### Predicting Diabetes Through Machine Learning Models

### Introduction

This project will attempt to identify and understand what factors play a role in the development of diabetes. 
We will accomplish this by analyzing a diabetes dataset and utilizing machine learning techniques and models learned throughout this semester of INFO 1998. 
The main questions we hope to answer through this project are which health and non-health factors are correlated to the development of diabetes and whether health or non-health factors are better at predicting diabetes.
In this project, we will first visualize the data in this dataset to determine which features of interest we will use to train our machine learning models. 
We will then use various machine learning models trained on these features to hopefully predict whether someone will have diabetes. 
Lastly we will analyze the effectiveness of our models and any conclusions we made along the way.
